# SF5 Show time, heart rate 
Secondary function SF5 displays the time, heart rate, and the shape of the PPG as a graph on two OLED screens.

## Technical Requirements
### TR5.1 The first screen must display the time and BPM value (or a dash if the value is not valid or the device is not positioned correctly).

### TR5.2 The second screen must display the PPG.

### TR5.3 The graph must be graduated, indicating the time base per number of horizontal pixels.

### TR5.4 Like on an oscilloscope, a rotary button (potentiometer) must allow changing the time scale of the graph display.
