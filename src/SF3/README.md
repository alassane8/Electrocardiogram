## Technical Requirements
### TR3.1 The three indicators must not be simultaneously illuminated.

### TR3.2 The system must be based on a heart rate range in accordance with medical standards:
- Red indicator: high heart rate;
- Green indicator: normal heart rate;
- Yellow indicator: low heart rate.

### TR3.3 If the system fails to calculate a realistic heart rate (aberrant value), no indicator should illuminate (to avoid causing concern to the user).
